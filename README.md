## WebScraping and Web Cracking
Web scraping is using a script to pull information from a website.
Web cracking uses a script to interact with and find information available online

## Description
This project uses the API for thebluealliance.com to find information on a specific FRC team for a specific year, listing out the top 10 and bottom 10 scoring match of the season, as well as the season average.

## Use
To start, first use cd to find the correct repository location. Then, run the python script. It will prompt for a year number (20xx), then a team number (FRC TEAM NUMBER, #, ##, ###, ####, or #####). After these are entered, the data will be printed in the terminal.
