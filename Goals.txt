We are going to create a program that will take data from the blue alliance API and use is to draw conclusions about 
    teams and robots related to their effectiveness in matches

We will be using code from:
    nlohmann/json - https://github.com/nlohmann/json


This application will be able to:
    - collect data from the blue alliance
    - use the data to:
        - make an accurate list of robots ranked by how good they are at scoring
        - create a heatmap for each individual robot of where that robot scores (?)
        - 
    -
